Changelog for current version:
    * Show the error texts from twitter when displaying an error. Should make it easier to understand things like why DMs fail.

Changelog for 0.6.3:
    * Fix make install target

Changelog for 0.6.2:

    * Add a "report spammer" link
    * Initial "Conversation" support available. Click on "In reply to..." and the parent tweet will be retrieve. It's currently delivered just like any other tweet; if it's from an IM session, it will be shown in a new IM window; if it's from a chat window, it will be shown at the bottom. I don't like this, but I don't have anything better at the moment.
    * More sensible login defaults; HTTPS, OAuth, password is optional (not required when using OAuth)
    * Snowflake API update; don't assume tweet_id's are sequential. This could have resulted in missing some tweets.
    * Fix the Makefile.mingw dependency bug where foo.dll wasn't being rebuilt. Note that there is no support for header dependencies; the pidgin makefiles, which we use, do not support them. If you change a head files, run make clean all
    * Automatically re-connect on server issues. 

Changelog for 0.6.1:

    * 64 bit installations now work. Use the regular build system
    * Proper build system. For Linux, run ./autogen.sh && make && make sudo install . Everything should "just work". For MinGW, run make -f Makefile.mingw PIDGIN_TREE_TOP=/path/to/pidgin-2.7.x/ VERSION=whatever. Note that I've only tested MinGW on Linux; Cygwin feedback is welcome.
    * Cleaned up a bunch of code warnings. No functional changes (hopefully) 

Changelog for 0.6.0:

    * Better Makefile & Installer support. Supports MinGW compilation (copy local.mak.mingw to local.mak in the prpltwtr and prpltwtr/gtkprpltwtr directories). The installer detects Pidgin installations (based on the registry) and PidginPortable (it looks in c:\PortableApps\PidginPortable, C:\Program Files\PortableApps\PidginPortable, and c:\Program Files\PortableApps\PortableApps\PidginPortable). Also, the installer installs .dbgsym files for meaningful crash reports.
    * Old style RTs and Reply-to-all added (as in  issue 36 )
    * "Lock reply" and other IM reply / in_reply_to improvements. See the description below
    * Preparation for retreiving a conversation. The UI code is in an #ifdef 0, so you won't see anything. Yet.
    * At least half a dozen crashes fixed, including when resuming from standby.
    * Delayed icons no longer show up in a line after clearing the buffer using Ctrl-L
    * Icon size is a gtkprpltwtr option
    * New style RTs include all 140 characters plus the RT @someone header (no more crops using "..." at the end)
    * Default retrieval quantities raised to 200 from 100. 

Rules for replies

   1. Messages sent to a user from the main input window will always be regular
   2. Messages sent from an IM window that opened automatically, or by clicking "reply" / "reply to all" will be in response to the last received message. (previous: no reply all)
   3. Messages sent from a chat window that was opened by double clicking on the buddy name will be regular, unless the window was already open because of the previous condition.
   4. Click on "Set Reply" will force all subsequent messages in that IM window to be in response to that particular tweet, even if new messages arrive. This can be cleared by (a) setting another tweet (b) choosing "More->Clear reply", (c) clicking on "reply" or "reply to all" to another tweet received, or (d) closing the window. While the fixed reply is in place, an icon will be shown to the right of the message being replied to. (previous: didn't exist)
   5. Closing an IM window will always clear the replies (previous: this didn't matter)
