Twitter protocol plugin tightly integrates Twitter to Maemo Contacts and Conversations. It imports your Twitter friends and saved search queries to Contacts, and receives mentions/replies, DMs and Twitter search results as conversation threads. In addition, you can send replies or DMs to any Twitter friend straight from Contacts, simply by tapping on their Twitter IDs.

This plugin is based on prpltwtr by neaveru (http://code.google.com/u/neaveru). You can find more information at my Twitter @rabbitrun84
